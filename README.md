  Hello everyone!  My name is Tyler Spore and I am a fourth year Ph.D. student finishing up this December in the Animal Science Department.  Additionally, I hold a full-time position as a Research Technician in the department where I am responsible for all of the metabolism research conducted on campus utilizing beef cattle and sheep models.  I have coding experience in SAS but most of the models we work with are simple mixed models.  I have very limited experience in R and would like to become more familiar with R coding for future use.
  I am originally from Eureka, Kansas and grew up working on a farm with row crops and cattle.  In my free time I enjoy doing anything in the outdoors and hunting and fishing are two of my favorite activitities.  Additionally, I enjoy studying, observing, and the many other animal husbandry activities involved in raising and studying cattle.
